# Corby's Escape

Corby's Escape is a 3d Third person game build in Bevy engine using Rust. It is about a robot named Corby who is imprisoned on a planet in space. His only crime was to save a human from planet earth from death. Corby wants to escape from the space prison and meet his friend who is locked on another planet.
Can you help Corby ?

It is my first game in Bevy engine and is also a ground for expermiments. I plan to add more game elements, proceduraly generated worlds, more enemies, game play mechanics and boss enemy.
